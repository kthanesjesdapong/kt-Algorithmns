What are Trees?
    1. Hierarchical Linked lists
    2. Has 0 || 1 root, with 0 || more subtrees
    3. Each node has 1 parent && 0 || more childs.
    4. Nodes are containers for data.
    5. If the tree has 0 roots IT IS EMPTY!!
    6. The top-most node is called root.
    7. A node without children is called leaf node or terminal node

What is Height within a tree? 
    1. The distance from the farthest leaf to the root (edge count)

What is Depth || Level of a node?
    1. distance between the root and the node in question



What are Binary Trees?
    1. Follows the same rules outlined for trees, but with more rules attached.
    2. Each node points from 0 to 2 child nodes.

What are Binary Search Trees?
    1. Binary Tree Rules applies
    2. Node keys is >= than all keys in its LEFT subtree.
    3. Node keys is <= than all keys in its RIGHT subtree.
    4. This helps us a lot when we want to find something || insert something.
    5. If the tree is balanced it will has a good balance of both L && R subtrees each time we just divide our number of options into TWO. Think Binary Search.

Traversal Methods for BST
    1. Pre-Order (Root, L, R)
    2. In-Order (L, Root, R)
    3. Post-Order (L, R, Root)
    4. Breadth-First-Search (Level by Level)
